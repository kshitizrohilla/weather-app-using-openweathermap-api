## Configuration
To use the OpenWeatherMap API, you need to obtain an API key. Follow these steps to set up your API key:

* Go to the OpenWeatherMap website: https://openweathermap.org/
* Sign up for a free account or log in if you already have an account.
* Once logged in, go to your profile and navigate to the "API Keys" section.
* Generate a new API key and copy it.
* In the project directory, locate the script.js file. Inside this file, you will find a constant called API_KEY. Replace the placeholder value 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key obtained from OpenWeatherMap.

```
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
```
